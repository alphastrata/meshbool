2. For each face:
   - Find furthest point from face
   - If distance > epsilon:
     - Create new faces using point and face edges
     - Remove old face
3. Repeat until no points outside hull
4. Triangulate hull faces
5. Return convex hull mesh

**Optimizations**:

4. Maintain mesh quality constraints
5. Return smoothed mesh

**Variants**:
