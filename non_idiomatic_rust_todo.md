# Non-Idiomatic Rust Issues in meshbool

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. Direct Translation from C++
Many parts of the code appear to be direct translations from C++ without considering Rust idioms:
- Manual memory management patterns that should use RAII
- Extensive use of raw pointers and unsafe code where safer alternatives exist
- C-style arrays and manual indexing instead of iterators
- Verbose error handling instead of using Rust's Result/Option types

### 2. Unsafe Pointer Usage
- Heavy reliance on raw pointers in polygon.rs and other files
- Manual memory management that could use smart pointers or owned data structures
- Potential for memory safety issues that Rust's ownership system is designed to prevent

### 3. Naming Conventions
- Mixed naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase)
- C++ style function names that don't follow Rust conventions
- Abbreviated variable names that hurt readability

### 4. Error Handling
- Functions that should return Result<T, E> instead of panicking
- Lack of proper error propagation using ? operator
- Missing documentation on when functions can fail

### 5. Module Organization
- Poor module separation with unclear responsibilities
- Overuse of `pub` visibility modifiers
- Lack of clear API boundaries

## Specific Areas Needing Attention

### Polygon Triangulation (polygon.rs)
- Extensive use of raw pointers for polygon vertex manipulation
- Manual memory management that could use Vec/Box
- Complex unsafe code that could be simplified with safe Rust constructs

### Halfedge Data Structures (shared.rs, impl.rs)
- C-style structs with manual lifetime management
- Raw pointer manipulation that could use references or smart pointers
- Lack of proper encapsulation

### Memory Management Patterns
- Manual allocation/deallocation patterns from C++
- Use of unsafe functions where safe alternatives exist
- Missing proper destructors/drop implementations

### API Design Issues
- Functions that take raw pointers instead of references
- Missing documentation on safety requirements
- Inconsistent parameter ordering
- Lack of builder patterns where appropriate

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions
1. Audit all unsafe code blocks and document their safety requirements
2. Replace raw pointer usage with safe alternatives where possible
3. Standardize naming conventions to follow Rust community standards
4. Improve module organization and reduce unnecessary pub visibility

### Medium-term Improvements
1. Refactor error handling to use Result/Option types properly
2. Implement proper Drop traits for automatic resource management
3. Replace manual indexing with iterators where appropriate
4. Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs

### Long-term Goals
1. Eliminate as much unsafe code as possible while maintaining performance
2. Implement proper unit tests for all modules
3. Add comprehensive documentation with examples
4. Consider using Rust-specific libraries for math operations (e.g., glam, cgmath alternatives)

## Priority Areas for Refactoring

1. **polygon.rs** - Contains the most unsafe pointer manipulation
2. **impl.rs** - Core data structures need better encapsulation
3. **shared.rs** - Memory management patterns need improvement
4. **vec.rs** - Custom vector implementations that could use standard library

## Code Quality Metrics to Track

1. Reduction in lines of unsafe code
2. Increased test coverage
3. Improved documentation coverage
4. Better module cohesion and reduced coupling
5. Fewer compiler warnings
