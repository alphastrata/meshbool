## ✅ Proven Working Examples

### `step_subtract_demo.rs`
**Core workflow demonstration:**
1. Loads STEP file (`real_parts/multifeature.step`)
2. Spawns STEP model and subtraction cube
3. Performs boolean subtract operation
4. Provides orbiting camera view with close-up positioning
5. Shows real-time status updates

**Output:**
```
STEP file loaded successfully!
STEP mesh has 28688 vertices
Entities created - STEP model: Entity { index: 5, generation: 1 }, Cube: Entity { index: 6, generation: 1 }, Result: Entity { index: 7, generation: 1 }
Boolean subtract operation initiated!
```
