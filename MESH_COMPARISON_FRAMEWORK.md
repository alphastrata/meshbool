# Mesh Comparison Framework

## Overview
The mesh comparison framework provides comprehensive tools to verify that our `meshbool` implementation produces results that are approximately equal to the original `manifold-rs` library. This ensures compatibility and correctness as we develop and refactor the codebase.

## Features

### 1. **Approximate Equality Testing**
Compares meshes for approximate equality by checking:
- Volume within tolerance
- Vertex count within tolerance  
- Triangle count within tolerance
- Vertex positions within tolerance
- Structural properties preservation

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Tests cover all core functionality:
- Basic mesh creation (cube, sphere, etc.)
- Transformations (translation, scaling, rotation)
- Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Advanced operations (cross-section, hull, SDF, smooth)

### 3. **Flexible Tolerance System**
Allows configurable tolerance levels for different types of operations:
- Basic operations: Tight tolerance (0.1)
- Complex operations: Looser tolerance (up to 0.15)

## Usage

### Basic Comparison
```rust
use meshbool::{cube, get_mesh_gl, translate};
use manifold_rs::Manifold;

// Create identical meshes in both implementations
let our_cube = cube(nalgebra::Vector3::new(2.0, 2.0, 2.0), true);
let their_cube = Manifold::cube(2.0, 2.0, 2.0);

// Compare for approximate equality
let result = approx_eq!(&our_cube, &their_cube);
assert!(result, "Basic cube mesh should be approximately equal");
```

### Custom Tolerance
```rust
// Use custom tolerance for complex operations
let result = approx_eq!(&our_complex_mesh, &their_complex_mesh, 0.15);
assert!(result, "Complex mesh should be approximately equal within 15% tolerance");
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Comparison
The framework compares the underlying `MeshGL` representations:

**Our Implementation (`meshbool`)**:
```rust
pub struct MeshGL {
    pub num_prop: u32,              // Properties per vertex
    pub vert_properties: Vec<f32>,   // Interleaved vertex data
    pub tri_verts: Vec<u32>,        // Triangle indices
    // ... additional metadata
}
```

**Their Implementation (`manifold-rs`)**:
```rust
pub struct Mesh {
    // C++ FFI wrapper with similar structure
    // vertices() -> &[f32] (x, y, z coords)
    // indices() -> &[u32] (triangle indices)
}
```

### Comparison Metrics

1. **Vertex Count**: `vert_properties.len() / num_prop` vs `vertices().len() / 3`
2. **Triangle Count**: `tri_verts.len() / 3` vs `indices().len() / 3`
3. **Volume**: Bounding box size comparison
4. **Position Accuracy**: Vertex coordinate matching within tolerance

### Tolerance Strategy
Different operations require different tolerance levels:

| Operation Type | Default Tolerance | Reasoning |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Basic Creation | 0.1 (10%) | Minimal variation expected |
| Translation | 0.0 (exact) | Should be identical |
| Union | 0.1 (10%) | Moderate variation due to triangulation |
| Intersection | 0.05 (5%) | Less variation expected |
| Difference | 0.15 (15%) | More variation due to complex geometry |
| Cross-section | 0.1 (10%) | Moderate variation |
| Hull | 0.1 (10%) | Moderate variation |
| SDF | 0.1 (10%) | Moderate variation |
| Smooth | 0.1 (10%) | Moderate variation |
