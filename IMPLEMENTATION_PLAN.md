# Implementation Plan: Proper Implementation of Stub Functions

## Overview
Currently, several key functions in the meshbool library are stubbed with placeholder implementations. These need to be properly implemented with:

1. **Real algorithms** instead of placeholder results
2. **Comprehensive tests** with proper validation
3. **Data-driven comparisons** with the original manifold-rs implementation
4. **Performance considerations** and edge case handling

## Functions to Implement

**Current Status**: Returns a simple cube as placeholder
**Required Implementation**: Compute actual cross-section at given Z-height
**Algorithm**: Mesh-plane intersection algorithm

### 2. hull (lib.rs:345) 
**Current Status**: Returns a simple cube as placeholder
**Required Implementation**: Compute convex hull using QuickHull or similar
**Algorithm**: QuickHull or Gift Wrapping algorithm
**Validation**: Compare hull results with manifold-rs

### 3. sdf (lib.rs:375)
**Current Status**: Returns a simple cube as placeholder  
**Required Implementation**: Compute signed distance field
**Algorithm**: Distance field computation with spatial indexing

### 4. smooth (lib.rs:404)
**Current Status**: Returns original mesh as placeholder
**Required Implementation**: Apply mesh smoothing algorithms
**Algorithm**: Laplacian smoothing or Taubin smoothing

### 5. triangulate_idx_safe (polygon_safe.rs:1048)
**Current Status**: Delegates to unsafe implementation
**Required Implementation**: Safe triangulation algorithm
**Algorithm**: Constrained Delaunay triangulation
